# Recursion Practice

This repository contains implementations of common recursive algorithms as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s curriculum. The project focuses on understanding and implementing recursive solutions to classic programming problems.

## Implementations

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence (`fibonacci.js`)
Contains two implementations of the Fibonacci sequence generator:
- `fibs(n)`: Iterative implementation
- `fibsRec(n)`: Recursive implementation

Both functions return an array containing the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

### 2. Merge Sort (`mergeSort.js`)
Implementation of the merge sort algorithm using recursion:
- `mergeSort(arr)`: Takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array
- Uses the divide-and-conquer strategy with recursive calls
- Includes a helper `merge()` function to combine sorted subarrays

## Running the Code

Each implementation can be run using Node.js:

```bash
# Run Fibonacci implementations
node fibonacci.js

# Run Merge Sort implementation
node mergeSort.js
```

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding recursive problem-solving
- Comparing iterative vs recursive solutions
- Implementing divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Working with recursive sorting algorithms
